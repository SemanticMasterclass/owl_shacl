## Tutorial: OWL or SHACL: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Making the Right Choice

### Abstract

As knowledge graphs become increasingly integral to enterprise data strategies, the adoption of semantic technologies continues to grow. However, one question arises repeatedly: Should I use Web Ontology Language (OWL), SHApes Constraint Language (SHACL), or a combination of both? This tutorial addresses that question by introducing the core concepts, their practical purposes, and real-world applications of OWL and SHACL, with a focus on understanding when each technology is most appropriate to use. Using a dataset from the museum domain, the session will guide participants through key use cases that demonstrate the distinct strengths and weaknesses of these technologies, as well as where they overlap. Through an example-driven, hands-on approach, attendees will explore how modeling, inference, and data validation are influenced by the use of OWL and SHACL. Participants will collaboratively analyze various problem scenarios to determine the most suitable language(s) for addressing each challenge. The tutorial will involve building ontologies, defining SHACL shapes, and validating data using open source tools. By the end of the session, attendees will have gained practical experience and a clear understanding of how to apply OWL and SHACL effectively in diverse knowledge graph development contexts.
